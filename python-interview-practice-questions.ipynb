Question:\nHow can you achieve multi-threading in Python?\n## Answer:\nPython has a threading module which can be used to achieve multi-threading.\nIn Python, multi-threading can be achieved using the threading module, which allows you to run multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently. Each thread runs independently and can perform tasks in parallel, which can be useful for I/O-bound tasks like reading from files, handling network requests, or performing tasks where waiting (e.g., for input/output) happens.\n\nHowever, due to Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), multi-threading does not give a true parallel execution of threads for CPU-bound tasks (tasks that require heavy computation). Instead, threads take turns executing. For CPU-bound tasks, using the multiprocessing module is generally more effective.\nSteps to Achieve Multi-threading:\n\n    Import the threading module.\n    Define a function that represents the task each thread will perform.\n    Create Thread objects and pass the target function to them.\n    Start the threads using the start() method.\n    Wait for the threads to complete using join().","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import threading\n\n# Function to be executed by each thread\ndef print_numbers():\n    for i in range(1,6):\n        print(i)\n\ndef print_letters():\n    for letter in 'abcde':\n        print(letter)\n        \n# Creating multiple threads\nt1 =threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)\nt2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)\n\n# Starting the threads\nt1.start()\nt2.start()\n\n# Waiting for both threads to complete\nt1.join()\nt2.join()\n\nprint(\"Both threads has completed the execution.\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-10-17T18:01:51.187419Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-10-17T18:01:51.188216Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-10-17T18:01:51.205095Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-10-17T18:01:51.188157Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-10-17T18:01:51.202381Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":5,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"1\n2\n3\n4\n5\na\nb\nc\nd\ne\nBoth threads has completed the execution.\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 16.

The default metaclass is type, but you can create your own metaclass to customize class behavior.\nHow Does a Metaclass Work?\n\nWhen you define a class in Python, Python creates it using a metaclass. By default, the type metaclass is used to create classes, but you can customize the process by defining your own metaclass.\nMetaclass type: Python uses type as the default metaclass, and it controls how classes are created.\nMetaclass Customization: You can define your own metaclass by inheriting from type and modifying the __new__ or __init__ methods.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 17. Question:\nDescribe the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its implications.\n## Answer:\nThe GIL is a mutex (or a lock) that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time in CPython (the standard Python implementation). This means that even on multi-core systems, only one thread is executed at a time. This can be a bottleneck for CPU-bound programs, but it is not generally an issue for I/O-bound programs.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Intermediate\n\n# 18. Question:\nWhat is the difference between staticmethod, classmethod, and regular instance methods?\n\n## Answer:\n\n    staticmethod: Doesn't take any specific first parameter (neither self nor cls), and acts just like a regular function but belongs to a class's namespace.\n    classmethod: Takes the class as its first parameter (usually named cls). It can be called on the class itself, rather than an instance.\n    Instance method: Takes the instance (object) as its first parameter (usually named self) and operates on it.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 19. Question:\nHow do you sort a dictionary by its values?\n### Answer\nTo sort a dictionary by its values in Python, you can use the sorted() function with a lambda function that specifies the sorting criteria.
