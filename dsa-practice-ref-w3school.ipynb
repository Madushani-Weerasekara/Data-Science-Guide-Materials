Each vertex represents an entity.\nEdges: The connections between vertices. An edge represents the relationship between two nodes.\n\n### Types of Graphs:\n\nDirected Graph (Digraph): In a directed graph, edges have a direction. They go from one vertex to another (e.g., social media follow relationships). Example: A -> B (A follows B).\n\nUndirected Graph: In an undirected graph, edges do not have a direction. The relationship is bidirectional (e.g., Facebook friends). Example: A -- B (A is friends with B).\n\nWeighted Graph: Each edge in a weighted graph has a weight or cost associated with it, often representing distance, time, or other metrics.\n\nUnweighted Graph: All edges are treated equally, without any specific weight or cost.\n\n### Graph Representation:\n\n    Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array (matrix) where each cell at position (i, j) indicates whether there is an edge between vertex i and vertex j. If there is an edge, it contains a 1 (or the weight of the edge); otherwise, it contains 0.\n\n    Adjacency List: A more space-efficient representation where each vertex has a list of adjacent vertices (neighbors) that are connected by edges.\n\n### Graph Traversal Algorithms:\n\n    Breadth-First Search (BFS): Traverses the graph level by level, exploring all neighbors at the present depth before moving on to nodes at the next level.\n    Depth-First Search (DFS): Traverses the graph as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.\n\n### Applications of Graphs:\n\n    Social Networks: Representing relationships between users.\n    Routing Algorithms: Finding the shortest path in computer networks or maps (e.g., Dijkstra's Algorithm).\n    Recommendation Systems: Graphs can represent the relationships between items (e.g., user-item interactions).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Basic implementation of a undirected graph\n\nvertexData = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']\n\nAdjacencyMetrix = [\n    [0, 1, 1, 1 ], #
