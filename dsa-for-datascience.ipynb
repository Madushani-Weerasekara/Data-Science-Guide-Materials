Using Data Structures to Manage the Queue of Cars at Each Traffic Light\n\n### Solution:\nUse queues to manage cars waiting at each light, as queues efficiently handle the \"first-in, first-out\" (FIFO) order that traffic lights follow.\n\nEach direction at the intersection (e.g., north, south, east, west) can have its own queue, representing cars waiting at that particular signal.\n\nThese queues can be represented as arrays, linked lists, or, in a more sophisticated implementation, as a standard queue data structure in programming languages like Python, Java, or C++.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##  Algorithm to Minimize Waiting Time for Cars\n\n### Solution:\nUse a greedy algorithm that continuously evaluates which queue has the longest wait time or the highest number of cars and gives it priority\n\nImplement a dynamic timing mechanism that adjusts signal duration based on the length of each queue. This approach is also called adaptive traffic control.\n\nFor example, if the east queue is much longer than others, the green light for the eastbound direction might last longer or turn green sooner.\n\n### Algorithm Steps:\nPeriodically assess the length of each queue (e.g., every few seconds).\n\nPrioritize the queue with the highest number of cars.\n\nAdjust the duration of the green light based on the queue length, allowing more cars to pass if a queue is long.\n\nRotate to the next longest queue to keep traffic balanced.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3. Handling Emergencies (e.g., Ambulances) to Bypass Normal Queues\n\n### Solution:\n\nUse a priority queue or heap data structure to prioritize emergency vehicles.\n\nIf an emergency vehicle (like an ambulance or fire truck) approaches, it is given higher priority over regular vehicles.\n\nThe system should detect this and temporarily override the queue sequence to give the emergency vehicle an immediate green light.\n\nPriority queues allow us to prioritize based on urgency. For instance, emergency vehicles can be tagged with the highest priority value.\n\n### mplementation Example:\n\nEach queue can be enhanced to hold both regular cars and emergency vehicles, using a priority flag.\n\nEmergency vehicles are enqueued with high priority, and as soon as they’re detected, the system checks if there’s an emergency in any queue. If so, the system grants green light access to that direction immediately.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# deque data structure to manage the queue of cars\n\nfrom collections import deque\nfrom time import sleep\nimport heapq # Heap data structure to handle mergencies to by pass normal queues\n\nnorth_queue = deque(['car1', 'car2', 'car3']) # queue for the cars waiting at the north signal\nsouth_queue = deque(['car1', 'car2', 'car3', 'car4', 'car5']) # queue for the cars waiting at the south signal\neast_queue = deque(['car1', 'car2', 'car3','car4', 'car5', 'car6', 'car7', 'car8', 'car9', 'car10']) # queue for the cars waiting at the east signal\nwest_queue = deque(['car1', 'car2', 'car3','car4', 'car5','car6', 'car7']) # queue for the cars waiting at the west signal\n\n# Greedy Algorithm to minimize cars waiting time\n\nqueues = {'north' :  north_queue, 'south' : south_queue, 'east' : east_queue, 'west' : west_queue}\n\n#priority queue for handling emergencies\nemergency_queue = []\n\n# Display each queue and its length for each direction\nfor direction, queue in queues.items():\n    print(f'Direction : {direction} Queue : {list(queue)} Length : {len(queue)}')\n    print() # new line\n\ndef green_light(direction):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simulates a green light for a specific direction.\n    Processes cars in the queue for that direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    print(f\"The light is green for {direction.upper()}.
